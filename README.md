# Smart Gesture
Recognize five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote

The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:

 - Thumbs up:  Increase the volume
 - Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
 - Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
 - Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds  
 - Stop: Pause the movie

Each video is a sequence of 30 frames (or images)

# Understanding the Dataset
The training data consists of a few hundred videos categorised into one of the five classes. Each video (typically 2-3 seconds long) is divided into a sequence of 30 frames(images). These videos have been recorded by various people performing one of the five gestures in front of a webcam - similar to what the smart TV will use. 

### TODO: Push the data file
The data is in a zip file. The zip file contains a 'train' and a 'val' folder with two CSV files for the two folders. These folders are in turn divided into subfolders where each subfolder represents a video of a particular gesture. Each subfolder, i.e. a video, contains 30 frames (or images). Note that all images in a particular video subfolder have the same dimensions but different videos may have different dimensions. Specifically, videos have two types of dimensions - either 360x360 or 120x160 (depending on the webcam used to record the videos). Hence, you will need to do some pre-processing to standardise the videos. 

Each row of the CSV file represents one video and contains three main pieces of information - the name of the subfolder containing the 30 images of the video, the name of the gesture and the numeric label (between 0-4) of the video.

# Two Architectures: 3D Convs and CNN-RNN Stack
After understanding and acquiring the dataset, the next step is to try out different architectures to solve this problem. 

For analysing videos using neural networks, two types of architectures are used commonly. One is the standard CNN + RNN architecture in which you pass the images of a video through a CNN which extracts a feature vector for each image, and then pass the sequence of these feature vectors through an RNN. 

The other popular architecture used to process videos is a natural extension of CNNs - a 3D convolutional network. In this project, we attempt to solve this using boththese architectures. 

## Convolutions + RNN
The conv2D network will extract a feature vector for each image, and a sequence of these feature vectors is then fed to an RNN-based network. The output of the RNN is a regular softmax (for a classification problem such as this one).

## 3D Convolutional Network, or Conv3D
D convolutions are a natural extension to the 2D convolutions you are already familiar with. Just like in 2D conv, you move the filter in two directions (x and y), in 3D conv, you move the filter in three directions (x, y and z). In this case, the input to a 3D conv is a video (which is a sequence of 30 RGB images). If we assume that the shape of each image is 100x100x3, for example, the video becomes a 4-D tensor of shape 100x100x3x30 which can be written as (100x100x30)x3 where 3 is the number of channels. Hence, deriving the analogy from 2-D convolutions where a 2-D kernel/filter (a square filter) is represented as (fxf)xc where f is filter size and c is the number of channels, a 3-D kernel/filter (a 'cubic' filter) is represented as (fxfxf)xc (here c = 3 since the input images have three channels). This cubic filter will now '3D-convolve' on each of the three channels of the (100x100x30) tensor.

There are a few key things to note about the conv-RNN architecture:

- We can use transfer learning in the 2D CNN layer rather than training your own CNN 
- GRU can be a better choice than an LSTM since it has lesser number of gates (and thus parameters)

## Data Ingestion Pipeline
In most deep learning projects you need to feed data to the model in batches (due to the large data size). This is done using the concept of generators. 

Creating data generators is probably the most important part of building a training pipeline. Although libraries such as Keras provide builtin generator functionalities, they are often restricted in scope and you have to write your own generators from scratch. For example, in this problem, you need to feed batches of videos, not images. Similarly, in an entirely different problem such as 'music generation,' we may need to write generators which can create batches of audio files.
